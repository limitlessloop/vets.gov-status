The [va.gov-teams repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team) has a lot of content. Below is a small collection of useful starting points...

# Orientation/onboarding
* [Engineering onboarding](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/backend/engineeringonboarding.md)
* [how to get access to back-end systems](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/orientation/request-access-to-tools.md#additional-steps-for-developers)
* [SSH Socks Setup Script](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/scripts/socks/)

# Development
* [Front-end best practices](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/frontend/engineering-best-practices.md)
* [Lots of Documentation about setting up the platform](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/)

# Architecture
* [Request for comment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/request-for-comment)
  * This seems like a thing similar to an ADR - it is a list of proposed engineering changes/practices. One example is the [decisions around tech stack for vets.gov/va.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/request-for-comment/languages-and-tech-stack.md)
* [some useful descriptions of the CMS integration for va.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/request-for-comment/2019-09-30-cms-integration.md)

# Platform and devops
* [CI/CD Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/backend/continuous-integration-process.md)
* [standard deployment process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/deployment.md)
* [Info on prometheus/statsD metrics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/backend/sending-metrics-using-statsd.md)
